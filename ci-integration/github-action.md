# GitHub Actions

DeviceCloud features a GitHub Action that can initiate a DeviceCloud run based on a user-defined ruleset. For example; triggering a test run on every PR, or per commit. \
\
The Github Action has been designed to be a drop-in replacement for the official Maestro Cloud Github Action for ease of use. If you are already using this simply point to ours instead with the same configuration settings, and ensure you update any secrets for the API key for your DeviceCloud account.

All installation and configuration instructions for the GitHub Action can be found on the GitHub Marketplace here - [https://github.com/marketplace/actions/device-cloud-action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/device-cloud-action)
