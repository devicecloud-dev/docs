# Service Level Agreements

### Enterprise Platform Uptime SLA <a href="#enterprise-platform-uptime-sla" id="enterprise-platform-uptime-sla"></a>

The following Service Level Agreement forms part of the Subscription Agreement between devicecloud.dev and Customer (the "Agreement"), will apply to the Services for Enterprise Customers specified in an Order Form during the applicable Subscription Term:

#### 1. Uptime Commitment <a href="#id-1-uptime-commitment" id="id-1-uptime-commitment"></a>

devicecloud.dev will provide Actual Availability for at least 99.9% of the total time in each calendar month during the Subscription Term, as measured by devicecloud.dev (the **"Uptime Commitment"**).

#### 2. Service Credits <a href="#id-2-service-credits" id="id-2-service-credits"></a>

If the Uptime Commitment is not met during any particular calendar month during the Subscription Term, then Customer will be eligible for a service credit provided that Customer reports to devicecloud.dev such failure to meet the Uptime Commitment and requests such Service Credit per this process.&#x20;

The amount of any Service Credit due hereunder shall be calculated as follows: X \* Y, where X = the total fees due from Customer to devicecloud.dev for the affected Services for the relevant calendar month (regardless of when billed or payable), and Y = the Credit Percentage corresponding with the Actual Availability provided (as a percentage of total time) for the relevant calendar month, as outlined in the table below.

| Actual Availability                                | Credit Percentage |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Less than 99.9% but greater than or equal to 99.0% | 10%               |
| Less than 99.0% but greater than or equal to 98.0% | 20%               |
| Less than 98.0% but greater than or equal to 96.0% | 30%               |
| Less than 96.0%                                    | 40%               |

#### 3. Credit Requests and Payment <a href="#id-3-credit-requests-and-payment" id="id-3-credit-requests-and-payment"></a>

To request a Service Credit, the Customer must send an email to [support@devicecloud.dev](mailto:support@devicecloud.dev) within 30 days of the end of the month in which the Uptime Commitment was not met. Customer must include their registered email address and the previously reported dates and times that there was no Service Availability. If devicecloud.dev confirms that Customer is eligible for a Service Credit, devicecloud.dev will issue a credit to Customer's account within 30 days. Service Credits are not refunds, cannot be exchanged into a cash amount, and may only be used against future billing charges. Except as outlined below, the Service Credits shall be Customer's sole and exclusive remedy and devicecloud.dev's sole and exclusive liability, for any failure by devicecloud.dev to meet the Uptime Commitment.
