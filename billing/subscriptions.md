# Subscriptions

DeviceCloud offers subscriptions for use of the service.

These are being rolled out during 2026 and may not be available to all users initially. Reach out to support if you need help.

### Pro Plan

This subscription costs $25 per month and comes with $25 of usage included which can be used as per [test-run-billing.md](test-run-billing.md "mention").

Additional usage beyond $25 will be billed as overage and charged in your next monthly payment.

This plan lets you run up to 5 iOS and 5 Android tests in parallel. Read about [concurrency-and-parallel-runs.md](../getting-started/concurrency-and-parallel-runs.md "mention") to understand how this may be reduced at peak times.

If you require support when using this plan, you can contact our team and community via Discord.\
