# Welcome to DeviceCloud

`devicecloud.dev` is a third-party Maestro Cloud and Robin Test alternative.

Maestro Cloud was sunsetted in January 2025, so now is a great time to switch to DeviceCloud.

Reasons to switch:

* Cheap unit-based pricing
* Up to 10 parallel runs
* It's much faster than Maestro Cloud
* It's much faster than Robin (unless you've purchased 10+ concurrent runners from them)
* Google Play APIs
* Tablets and iPads
* Longer flow run timeout (10 mins)
* Fast support response times (via Discord)
