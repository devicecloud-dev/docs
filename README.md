# Welcome to DeviceCloud

DeviceCloud is a third-party Maestro Cloud and Robin Test alternative.

Reasons to switch:

* Cheap unit-based pricing
* Up to 20 parallel runs
* It's much faster than Maestro Cloud
* It's much faster than Robin (unless you've purchased 10+ concurrent runners from them)
* Google Play APIs
* Tablets and iPads
* Longer flow run timeout (10 mins)
* Fast support response times (via Discord)
