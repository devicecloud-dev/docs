# Device Locale

Set device language and region for localization testing.

{% hint style="info" %}
The default locale for Android is `en_US` . The default locale for iOS is currently `en_GB` but will be changing to `en_US` later in 2025.
{% endhint %}

## Format

`{language_code}_{COUNTRY_CODE}`

* Language: ISO-639-1 (lowercase)
* Country: ISO-3166-1 (uppercase)

## Usage

To set locale for the whole upload:

```bash
# German
dcd cloud ... --device-locale de_DE

# With device selection
dcd cloud ... --android-device pixel-6 --device-locale ja_JP
```

To override locale for a specific test, pass in the DeviceCloud env variable. This will override the upload setting above, but just for a single test:

```yaml
# in your test.yaml
appId: my.app
env:
    DEVICECLOUD_OVERRIDE_DEVICE_LCOALE: de_DE
---
# test steps
```
